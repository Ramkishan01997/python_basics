List
A list is a mutable (changeable) data structure, meaning you can modify it after its creation (e.g., add, remove, or change elements).

Characteristics of a List:
Mutable: You can modify elements after the list is created.
Dynamic Size: You can add or remove elements.
Ordered: Elements maintain the order in which they are added.
Indexable: You can access elements using an index.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]


###
Tuple
A tuple is an immutable data structure, meaning you cannot modify it after it is created.

Characteristics of a Tuple:
Immutable: Elements cannot be changed after the tuple is created.
Fixed Size: The number of elements is fixed.
Ordered: Elements maintain the order in which they are added.
Indexable: You can access elements using an index.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)

###
Dictionary
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique and maps to a corresponding value.

Characteristics:
Unordered: Prior to Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered. In Python 3.7+, they maintain insertion order.
Key-Value Pairs: Data is stored as key: value pairs.
Mutable: You can modify a dictionary (add, update, or remove items).
Keys Must Be Unique: Duplicate keys are not allowed.
Keys Must Be Immutable: Keys can be strings, numbers, or tuples, but not mutable objects like lists.



####
Set
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is similar to a mathematical set.

Characteristics:
Unordered: The elements do not have a defined order.
Unique Elements: Duplicate elements are automatically removed.
Mutable: You can add or remove elements.
Immutable Elements: Elements must be immutable (e.g., numbers, strings, tuples).
